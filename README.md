Hey, this is my first try at a project on Rails. I am developing a website for my local Mandurah Limousine Hire Service in Western Australia and i am sure that i can develop something unique and extraordinary using Rails.

I have limited experience with Rails compared to my extensive experience in the luxury limo hire business in Rockingham and Mandurah WA. The owner of [Mandurah Limo Hire](http://www.rockinghamlimo.com/mandurah_limo.html) is a guy name Pete who is hoping to get a lot more leads from the new website. He also serves the Rockingham and surrounding areas with his luxury cars.

Anyway, getting back to the technicalities, i usually build my websites on weebly but i am curious on the difference in indexing and ranking results using the Rails platform.... if i can call it that :) I have already been able to rank nearly all my weebly websites for the major search terms even for some really tough business niches, but there have also been a few phrases in a couple of catagories that have been really tough. I am hoping to change that now.

Limo Hire Mandurah - how important is the search phrase?

Pete from Mandurah Limo Hire otherwise known as White Pearl Limos and i have been working together for about 12 months now and i have bought him heaps of referrals or leads as they sometimes call them. In this time i have learned , both from experience and adwords, the two most important phrases to rank for in the Rockingham, Mandurah area are Limo Hire Mandurah and [Mandurah limousines](http://www.rockinghamlimo.com/mandurah_limo.html).

Understanding the importance of these search phrases makes it easier for me to focus on methods to rank the website.
